I hope this set of fruit sprites make a welcome addition to your game. There are 31 different types 
of fruit, each with sliced or opened versions, and some with alternate colours, for a total of 236 sprites 
(118 regular + 118 highlighted in black).

Art assets included are:
1. .PSD file reglar version of fruit, with Magic Pink background included (just turn on the layer in Photoshop).
2. .PSD file all fruit highlighted in black, with Magic Pink background included (just turn on the layer in Photoshop).
3. Spritesheet in .PNG format with transparent background, sliced and ready for use.

Thank you for your purchase, and please leave feedback in the review section!
