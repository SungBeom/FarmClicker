I hope this set of vegetable sprites make a welcome addition to your game. There are 41 different types 
of vegetables, each with sliced or opened versions, and some with alternate colours, for a total of 262 sprites 
(131 regular + 131 highlighted in black).

Art assets included are:
1. .PSD file reglar version of vegetables, with Magic Pink background included (just turn on the layer in Photoshop).
2. .PSD file all vegetables highlighted in black, with Magic Pink background included (just turn on the layer in Photoshop).
3. Spritesheets in .PNG format with transparent background, already sliced and named, ready for use.

Thank you for your purchase, and please leave feedback in the review section!
